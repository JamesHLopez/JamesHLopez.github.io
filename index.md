## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3
This lab was very interesting since we learned about using data variables such as 
weight, age, height, and identity to output their BMR. Then, part 2 of lab 3 was 
a program that asks you for two dates and gives you the time between those two dates. 
I liked this lab because it showed how valuable and applicable a piece of code can 
be to help solve problems.

Lab 6
This lab was one of my favorite labs since we learned how to play blackjack in our program. 
The lectures were interesting and fun, and the lab was not too bad I wanted to test and run 
the code to play the game. 

Lab 9
This was also one of my favorite labs since we got to create a spellchecker. 
For me, this is a very useful tool that I use in my everyday life, 
so it was very intriguing to me to learn how to make one. 
I gave me a glimpse of what I could do in creating a program.
